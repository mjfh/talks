  motivation for compiling to C
    Checking out well known systems
    Using plain/bare bone C
    Solution: Compile to C
      note: rust used ownersip model for dyn memory control
  choices, candidates
    Useful tools to generate C code
  result
    I ended up choosing NIM

  examples
    Hello World
    Oddities/Niceties
      explain tail() function, sequences, will come back to that later
    Simple Functional Stuff

  Summary
    NIM Summary

Code example
  example.nim
    compiler, show executables
      make run
        compile and test
      make min
        minimal exe
      make bin
        standard exe
    walk generated sources
      show testHead in NIM source code example.nim
      find testhead in C source code example-run-nostrip.c
      find testhead in C source code example-minimal-strip.c
        constant was pre-processed with custom function
